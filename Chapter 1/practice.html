                Cats make wonderful pets for various reasons, 
                and people often find joy and companionship in having them 
                as part of their families. Here are several reasons 
                why cats are considered good pets:
                <ol>
                    <li>Affectionate Companionship: 
                        Despite the stereotype of cats being aloof, 
                        many cats are affectionate and enjoy spending 
                        time with their human companions.
                        
                        They may snuggle, purr, and provide comfort, 
                        creating a strong bond with their owners.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Low Maintenance: Cats are generally more 
                        independent than some other pets.
                        They groom themselves, use a litter box, 
                        and don't require walks like dogs. 
                        This can be especially beneficial for 
                        people with busy lifestyles or those 
                        living in apartments.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                Dogs make great pets for their loyalty,
                companionship, and diverse abilities. 
                They provide emotional support, 
                enhance physical activity through walks and play, 
                and can be trained for various tasks. 
                Dogs often become valued family members 
                due to their affectionate nature and unwavering loyalty.

                Hedgehogs can be unique and endearing pets. 
                They are relatively low maintenance,
                have distinct personalities, 
                and their quills offer a 
                fascinating and distinctive feature.
                However, they may not be as 
                interactive or affectionate 
                as some other pets, and proper care, 
                including a suitable environment and diet, 
                is crucial for their well-being.
