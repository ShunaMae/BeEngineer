                    Dogs make great pets for their loyalty,
                    companionship, and diverse abilities. 
                    They provide emotional support, 
                    enhance physical activity through walks and play, 
                    and can be trained for various tasks. 
                    Dogs often become valued family members

                    Hedgehogs can be unique and endearing pets. 
                    They are relatively low maintenance,
                    have distinct personalities, 
                    and their quills offer a 
                    fascinating and distinctive feature.
                    However, they may not be as 
                    interactive or affectionate 
                    as some other pets, and proper care, 
                    including a suitable environment and diet, 
                    is crucial for their well-being.
